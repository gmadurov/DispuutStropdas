create survice account and copy the data into the admin pannel 



If you want your website or app to make events or calendars without have to use the Google accounts of the users you should use service accounts.

In https://console.cloud.google.com/ choose your project or start new one.

In the navigation menu choose "APIs & Services" enable new APIs and then look up "calendar API", enable the API

Under "APIs & Services">"Credentials", select "Create Credentials" and click on "service account", fill in the desired name, and continue. Set role as owner(or other desired)(owner gives full access you you might want to switch to something less powerful). Click "Done"

This will redirect you to the credentials page. Under the "Service accounts" click on the desired account(this will redirect you to the IAM & Admin panel) Under the tab "Keys" click "ADD KEY" and select json, this will download a json file to your computer.

in the Calendar page in google get and add the calendar ID to the admin panel under AgendaClients "CalendarId" add the service account to the people shared as admin (make changes to events)
